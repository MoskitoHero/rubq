# Rubq
Rubq allows access to Google Bigquery the rails way.

## Usage
Here be dragons!

This is still very much of a work in progress. Unusable for now.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rubq'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install rubq
```

## Contributing
I will add contribution guidelines as soon as this is ready to use.
